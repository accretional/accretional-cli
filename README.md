# accretional-cli

Accretional is working on a command-line interface (CLI) for automatic usage of our products. Currently, none of our products strictly require usage of a CLI to access them.

## Looking for something else?

For information on our Statue static site generator for Svelte, check out its repo at https://github.com/accretional/statue

Statue is also available over npm at https://www.npmjs.com/package/statue-ssg

We currently have paused development on our tool for local search and retrieval-augmented generation called Semantifly, but information about its CLI can be found within https://github.com/accretional/semantifly
